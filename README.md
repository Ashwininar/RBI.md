RBI has constantly tried to combat inflation through its rate hikes. RBI feels that increasing the cost of borrowing and making the new project fund raising expensive can control the spending to some extent. Developers and builders will be forced to raise the property prices which will impact the demand for housing and cost of home loans will also increase. Thus due to high prices demand will decrease gradually and people will postpone the purchasing plans which can ultimately pull down the demand thus controlling inflation.
## How is India Getting Impacted due to Rate Hike and Inflation?
- India has been witnessing sharp rise in the inflation due to spike in crude oil prices in the international market and increase in the commodity prices due to war between Russia and Ukraine. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been rising since September 2022 and remained above the tolerance band for Reserve Bank of India. Crude Oil prices were the biggest contributors for inflation in India. As India imports 80% of the crude oil , prices for raw materials, production and transportation also faced price rise. 
- The second major reason that contributed to inflation is Food Inflation. It also plays a very essential role in CPI inflation index.  The third factor that effected India is Russia Ukraine War which led to rise in price of not only crude oil but also disrupted to   global economic supply chain.  The fourth most important factor that contributed to India’s rising inflation is Covid 19 pandemic, due to which there is a global economic slowdown.  Also the US Inflation has increased the cost of labour in US Economy. There has been a massive layoff by US Companies which has effected jobs of many and these includes Indians too.
- US Fed has also increased their rates in the recent year to curtail inflation as they want to control the money in circulation.  Higher Interest rates forces people to control their expenditures.  The rise of rates in US might attract the investors to park their money in US. Thus RBI will also raise the rate of interest and restrict the money circulation. Thus rupee becomes more expensive thus landing exporters and importers in Trouble.
- Thus RBI in India has raised Repo rates in India as the process of recovery and due to this interest rates of loans in India are also rising. Companies are borrowing funds to meet their working capital needs and it has increased the borrowing cost.
